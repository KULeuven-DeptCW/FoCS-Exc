\begin{exercise}
A permutation on a set $\accl{1,\ldots,k}$ is a one-to-one, onto function on this set. When $p$ is a permutation, $p^t$ means the composition of $p$ with itself $t$ times. Let
\begin{equation}
\langdef{Perm-Power}=\condset{\tupl{p, q, t}}{p = q^t\mbox{ where $p$ and $q$ are permutations on $\accl{1,\ldots,k}$ and $t$ is a binary integer}}
\end{equation}
Show that $\langdef{Perm-Power}\in P$.
\begin{note}
Note that the most obvious algorithm does not run within polynomial time.
\end{note}
\begin{hint}
First try it where $t$ is a power of $2$.

Let $\langdef{Double-Sat}=\condset{\tupl{\phi}}{\phi\mbox{ has at least two satisfying assignments}}$. Show that $\langdef{Double-Sat}\in\mbox{NP-complete}$.
\begin{answer}
In order to do this we need to show two things: \langdef{Double-Sat} is in \cclass{NP} and there exists a reduction from \textsc{Sat} in polynomial time to \langdef{Double-Sat}. We first proof \langdef{Sat} can be reduced to \langdef{Double-Sat}:
\begin{quote}\begin{proof}
Given a Boolean function $\phi$ with variables $x_1,x_2,\ldots x_n$, we can convert it to a Boolean function $\phi'=\phi\wedge\brak{x_{n+1}\vee\neg x_{n+1}}$. In other words we've added an additional variable and a clause that is always true, whatever the value of $x_{n+1}$ is. If there is a valid assignment $\vec{x}$ for $\phi$, there are two assignments for $\phi'$ (namely the original assignment with $x_{n+1}$ true and one with $x_{n+1}$ false). If on the other hand if $\phi$ has no valid assignment, then whatever the value of $x_{n+1}$ is, there is no assignment for $\phi$. We can convert any Boolean formula $\phi$ to a formula $\phi'$ in polynomial time by enumerating over the input, counting the number of involved variables and add the defined suffix at the end of the input. We have thus reduce \langdef{Sat} to \langdef{Double-Sat} in polynomial time.
\end{proof}\end{quote}
Furthermore we need to proof that the problem is in \cclass{NP}:

\begin{exercise}
A colouring of a graph is an assignment of colours to its vertices so that no two adjacent vertices are assigned the same colour. Let
\begin{equation}
\langdef{3Colour}=\condset{\tupl{G}}{\mbox{the vertices of $G$ can be coloured with three colours such that no two vertices joined by an edge have the same colour.}}
\end{equation}
Show that $\langdef{3Colour}$ is $\mbox{NP-complete}$.
\begin{hint}
The reduction will be of the form $\mbox{3SAT}\leq_p\langdef{3Colour}$. Use the subgraphs depicted on \figref{exc48-graph1}.
\importtikzfigure{exc48-graph1}{Subgraphs used to reduce.}
\paragraph{}
The three colours correspond to true ($T$), false ($F$), and a third one (gray) to help enforce that other nodes are coloured $T$ or $F$. Each variable is modeled using the two nodes marked $w$ and $\neg w$. The first graph is used to enforce that $w$ and $\neg w$ are assigned values $T$ and $F$ or $F$ and $T$. The second graph is used to denote binary logical OR between the two legs $l$ and $r$, which may be either variables or other the roots ($\vee$) of other logical ORs. To ensure that an OR is coloured T, every root $\vee$-node is connected to $F$ and $N$.
\begin{example}
For example, the graph on \figref{exc48-graph2} corresponds to the encoding of $w\vee\neg v$.
