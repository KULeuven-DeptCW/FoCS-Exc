\begin{question}
About the reduction of decidability problems. Example 6.4.6 in the course text of \emph{Dave Clarke} it seems
one aims to solve the \textsc{Finite}-problem by designing an algorithm that uses the \textsc{Halting}-problem.
This is not a proof since one makes use of the fact whether the machine halts and the \textsc{Halting}-problem
is undecidable as well.
\begin{answer}
The course text does not show a reduction from the \textsc{Finite}-problem to the \textsc{Halting}-problem
\end{answer}
\end{question}
